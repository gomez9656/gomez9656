### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Electronic Engineer who wants to create Embedded Systems for a sustainable future. I am seeking a challenging position  as an Embedded Systems/Software Engineer where I can impact people's lives.

As a Release Manager, I learned Git, GitLab, and Jenkins. Software from development to production was my key responsibility. I identified risks that could delay the release and solved them with the different teams.

Embedded C, RTOS, ARM, debugging, hardware-software level development, timers, and interrupts are among the skills I have learned through certifications, hobby projects, and working as a Freelancer in Upwork.

In college, I was a member of an A+D research group. where I worked as an Embedded systems developer. I feel proud of developing a Python app to do automatic drilling in PCBs, using a 3D printer. This software helped me to design and prototype 2 other projects:

- PCB Arduino shield for an inverted pendulum that helped students to practice continuous control subjects.
- IoT prototype to control several 3D printers at the workshop, while the students are at home. Saving time and identifying errors early.

You can check all these projects here on GitHub.

My native language is Spanish. I have fluent English and intermediate German. Don't hesitate to contact me here. Do it in German, I would like to improve it!
