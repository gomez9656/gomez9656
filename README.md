### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Electronic Engineer who wants to create Embedded Systems for a sustainable future. I am seeking a challenging position in Germany as an Embedded Systems/Software Engineer.

As a Release Manager I learned Git, GitLab and Jenkins. Software from development to production was my key responsibility. I identified risks that could delay the release and solved them with the different teams.

Embedded C, RTOS, ARM, debugging, hardware software level development, timers and interrupts are among the skills I have learned trough certifications and hobby projects as a Brick Breaker game.

In college I was a member of an A+D research group. where I feel proud of developing a Python software to do automatic drilling in boards, using a 3D printer. This software helped me to design and prototype 2 other projects:

- PCB Arduino shield for students to practice continuous control subjects
- IoT prototype to control several 3D printers at the workshop, while the students are at home. Saving time and identifying errors early

You can check all this projects here on GitHub

My native language is Spanish. I have a fluent English and an intermediate German. Don't hesitate to contact me here. Do it on German, I would like to improve it!
