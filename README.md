### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about turning ideas into reality through embedded systems design. Whether itâ€™s developing firmware or PCBs, I create reliable, efficient, scalable, secure, and easy-to-maintain solutions.

My work focuses on ARM microcontrollers in C/C++. From prototyping and testing to final production, Iâ€™m hands-on in delivering firmware and hardware solutions that work seamlessly together.

Here are a few products my clients have received:
- AWS IoT embedded system with ESP32, facilitating stepper motor control via a user-friendly web portal and incorporating OTA updates.

- BLE MESH app with OTA in ESP32-C3, enabling mobile management of over 20 light fixtures for studio lighting setups.

- IoT app with ESP32-CAM to store temperature images in the cloud using long-range communication for irrigation control and efficient water management.

- BLE application on nRF chips to establish real-time connections with heart rate sensors, enabling precise monitoring and data acquisition.

- Car panel GUI in NXP chip with an intuitive design, enabling seamless control of data metrics and diverse configuration options.

- STM32 bare metal application using STM32CubeIDE to control light fixtures using the DMX protocol, rotatory encoders, and a UI interface using an LED display.

Skills and expertise:
- Firmware development: Proficient in creating firmware for ARM, AVR, and PIC microcontrollers in bare metal, event-driven, state machine, and RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr) architectures.

- PCB design: Experienced in designing multi-layer PCBs using Altium, KiCad, Eagle, and EasyEDA. Familiar with selecting components based on specifications, availability, and cost.

- IoT: Experienced in integrating IoT devices with cloud services like AWS and Azure. Knowledgeable in BLE, BLE Mesh, WiFi, HTTP, HTTPS, MQTT, CoAP, and others.

- Embedded UI: Capable of developing UIs for resource-constrained environments using LVGL, TouchGFX, QT, and Embedded Wizard.

- Peripherals: GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, Timer, ADC, DAC, Watchdog, DMA, RTC, PLL, CAN, USB, and CRC.

- Embedded Linux: Experienced in creating tailored Linux distributions and device drivers, familiar with build systems like Yocto and Buildroot.

- Security: secure boot, firmware encryption, authentication protocols, and best practices for secure firmware updates.

- Mobile app integration: Capable of programming microcontrollers for seamless communication with mobile applications.

- Version control: Git and GitHub for managing source code and teamwork.

- Microcontrollers: ESP32 / ESP32-S2 / ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C3 / TTGO T-Camera / ESP8266 / Nordic nRF52 DK / nRF24L01 / STM32F4xx Nucleo Board / STM32F1xx / STM32F3xx / STM32H7xx / Arduino Uno / Mega / Nano / TI MSP432 Launchpad Board / MSP430G / MSP430FR / NXP FRDM-KL25Z Board / Raspberry Pi / BeagleBone Black / PIC16 / PIC18 / PIC32

If you need a skill that isnâ€™t listed, just ask. Iâ€™m a fast learner and can quickly get up to speed with new technologies and protocols by diving into the technical documentation. My lab is fully equipped with all the essentialsâ€”oscilloscope, power supply, multimeter, and soldering stationâ€”so I can test hardware and speed up prototype development.

You can check out my repos to see my work in areas like bare metal programming, FreeRTOS, HAL API, ESP-IDF, and Nordic SDK.

Whether working solo or as part of a team, my goal is to deliver top-notch embedded systems that exceed expectations. If youâ€™re developing a new project or enhancing an existing one, letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™d love to discuss your needs and show you how I can make a difference. Drop me a message, and weâ€™ll get started.
