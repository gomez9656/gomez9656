### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Embedded Software | Firmware Engineer who wants to design innovative embedded systems that make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives. 

I specialize in designing reliable, efficient, and easy-to-maintain firmware in C/C++ for ARM microcontrollers, with a deep understanding of embedded systems architecture and proven track record in prototyping, testing, and delivering software and hardware products to market.

Here's a few examples of the products my clients are getting: 

-BLE MESH app with OTA updates in ESP32-C3 to control 20+ light equipment for a studio set from a mobile device.

-IoT app with ESP32-CAM to take temperature images and store them in the cloud using long-range communication for irrigation control and efficient water management.

-BLE app in C/C++ using nRF chips to connect to heart rate sensors for real-time monitoring and data collection.

-Embedded system in C using the ESP8266, a custom PCB shield, and an IoT cloud to enable automatic operation of 3D printers

Iâ€™m a versatile engineer and willing to accept new challenges, so I have a wide range of experience with different technologies, protocols, peripherals, and microcontrollers, among them:

Microcontrollers
-Espressif ESP32 / ESP8266 / ESP32-C3
-Arduino Uno / Mega / Nano
-STM32F4xx Nucleo Board
-TI MSP432 Launchpad Board
-NXP FRDM-KL25Z board
-Nordic nRF52 DK / nRF24L01
-TTGO T-Camera
-Raspberry

Technologies and protocols
-IoT / RTOS / WIFI / BLE / BLE MESH / LoRa

Peripherals
-GPIO / UART / I2C / SPI / PWM / Timer / ADC / DAC / Watchdog / DMA / RTC / PLL / CRC
